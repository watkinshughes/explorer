# Exercise: Build an Explorer

This exercise is to build a folder and file explorer (or a tree control). You must use ReactJS for this project. We recommend using https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app to bootstrap your project, but you can set it up however you'd like.

Please do not use an off-the-shelf tree control packages or any CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap or Foundation) since that would
defeat the purpose of this project!

## Requirements

### Application
* Create a new file `index.html` that renders an interactive file explorer shown in `mockup.png`
* Use the data from `data.json` to render the actual folders & files. You can make the data in `data.json` a global variable so that you don't need to load it with AJAX.
* We will run your code by opening your project, running `npm install` and `npm start`, and viewing the result at localhost:3000

#### Appearance
* What you build should look like a modal but doesn't need to function like one. (i.e. opening/closing and dragging it around are not necessary)
* Visually has appearance similar to that of `mockup.png` (private folders should have the red icon appearance)

### Minimum Features
* Folders should be able to expand or collapse by clicking on the expand/collapse icon. 
* Folders and files should have a hover appearance (such as highlighting the row blue).
* Folders and files are selected by clicking on the row, but only one folder or file should be selected at a time. A selected folder/file should have some sort of special appearance (such as highlighting the row green)

### Advanced Features (Not Required!)
Below are advanced features you do NOT need to implement, but **need to plan for**. In later interviews,
you may be asked exactly how you would implement all of these into your app.

* Add a button "Export". This should export the exact state & configuration of your app - the folders & files structure,
which ones are expanded/collapsed, which one is selected. You should decide what you want the exported configuration file to hold.
* Add a button "Import". This should allow the user to import data that you exported from the above feature and
re-render the explorer to the state specified in the imported file.
* Add a button "Add". This should allow the user to add a new file or folder to the location that is currently selected.
* Add the ability to move a file or folder by dragging it to another location.


## Evaluation Criteria

1. Minimum features completed
2. DRY, reusable, well-thought-out code that lays good infrastructure for implementing all of the Advanced Features
3. Simplicity of overall solution
4. Clean CSS rendering of `mockup.png` in latest Chrome
