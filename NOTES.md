#Notes

There are two branches in this repo. `master` and `import-export` 
The `master` branch solves the minimum requirements of the exercise and the `import-export` branch begins to solve for importing and exporting the state of the application via an Express server.

**The structure of the two branches is different enough that one probably needs to destroy the project folder and re-run `npm install` when switching to the `import-export` branch.**
